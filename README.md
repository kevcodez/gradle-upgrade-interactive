CLI to interactively upgrade Gradle dependencies, inspired by yarn.

Easily upgrade your dependencies and Gradle itself by simply selecting what you want to upgrade.

## Requirements

- NodeJS 18+
- [gradle-versions-plugin](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin)

## Installation

build.gradle

```groovy
plugins {
  id "com.github.ben-manes.versions" version "0.49.0"

```sh
npm i -g gradle-upgrade-interactive

  --no-color           Disables color output
```

## How it works

The [gradle-versions-plugin](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin) is called to generate a JSON report containing the outdated dependencies.
The CLI will then prompt all outdated dependencies and the selected dependency upgrades will be written to the Gradle build file.
